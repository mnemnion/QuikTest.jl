## Roadmap

- [ ]  Evaluate `answer == eval(parse(answer))`, mark tests which don't pass
- [ ]  Interactive picker with suffix completion (this is its own package)
- [ ]  [S]plit and [R]efine commands
- [ ]  Make .header a function that checks .aux to see if the menu needs pruning and
       does so when it becomes safe.
